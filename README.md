# Planets
Planets is a Python project I've been working on that generates data of planets that looks and feels "real enough" for me.

Obviously, it isn't perfect, but it works and is fairly simple.

## How can I use it?
Well, first, check the licence to make sure you're working within the licence.

If you are working within the licence, just download the code and run it as Python. You need the relevant libraries (random, numpy, and pandas) installed, in addition to Python.

IF you'd like to create GPT-3 ready outputs, remove the comment at the start of the line. You'd also probably be best adding some export to text - note these are for the OpenAI GPT-3 playground, not API-ready.

## Features
### Current features
- Generates names & other info
- Export to XLSX (currently commented out, removed the Y/N feature because it was annoying)
- GPT-3 ready output (currently commented out)

### Working on
- Minerals
- Atmosphere and composition

### Future features
- More planet types
- Generating more detailed moons as well
- Create generative art out of it (long term)
- Better, more realistic naming engine that isn't just drawing together random syllables
